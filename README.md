Testing Perl's Devel::Cover

# Description
Following some strange statement scores from tests at `$work`, it seemed
prudent to understand why the scores reported by [Devel::Cover](http://p3rl.org/Devel::Cover)
were fluctuating between builds, despite running the same code.

I have attempted to break the tests up into their relevant sections based on
the metric type I am testing.
